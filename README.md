## Visualizations and Insights
Key insights from the analysis include:

1. **Top Crime Types**  
   Theft and battery are the most common crimes, accounting for a significant percentage of total incidents.

2. **Crime Trends Over Time**  
   Crime rates have fluctuated but show a general decline in recent years.

3. **Top Crime Locations**  
   - **Streets**
   - **Residences**
   - **Sidewalks**  
   These are the most frequent crime locations, suggesting public and residential areas as hotspots.

4. **Arrest Rates**  
   Only a small percentage of reported crimes result in arrests, indicating a resolution gap.

5. **Seasonal Trends**  
   Crimes peak in the **summer months** (June, July, and August), likely due to increased outdoor activities.

6. **Neighborhood Crime Counts**  
   Specific community areas and districts report significantly higher crime counts, requiring targeted interventions.
